# Command Line Automation
Executing command line commands from Unity

## Project Description

### What does this do?
An example of how to call command-line instructions from Unity, at Runtime and Editor time.

### Technologies used
This package has no dependencies apart from C# and Unity. It has a custom REPL, and custom string parser.

## How to install
0. This is unencumbered open-source software, don't expect any tech support!
1. Open your favorite version of Unity that is newer than 2021.3 (older versions may work, I just haven't tested)
2. In the Unity Package Manager, add a new package by gitURL. Use the git URL, optionally including a specific branch of commit hash (eg: `https://github.com/mvaganov/CmdLineAutomation#cfc02381b9acaebf81af749e63ad7e653f711e06`)

## How to use this project
The Unity package has a Samples folder, which should experimented-with to see how the code in this project works. Some assets require a copy in your Project's Assets folder, because file fromgitURL packages (in the `Library/PackageCache`) are read-only.
